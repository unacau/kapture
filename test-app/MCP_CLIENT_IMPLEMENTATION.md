# MCP Client Implementation Changes

## Overview
Refactored the test app from manual JSON-RPC message construction to using the official MCP SDK (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`).

## Key Changes

### 1. Added MCP SDK Dependency
- Added `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk: ^1.12.3` to package.json

### 2. Replaced Manual JSON-RPC with SDK Client
- Removed manual message ID tracking and pending request management
- Removed manual JSON parsing and buffer management
- Added `Client` from the MCP SDK

### 3. Created Custom Transport
Since the SDK's `StdioClientTransport` expects to spawn the process itself, created a custom transport that works with our already-spawned process:
- Uses `ReadBuffer` from the SDK for proper message parsing
- Handles stdio streams from the existing process
- Implements the transport interface required by the SDK

### 4. Updated IPC Handlers
Replaced generic `sendMCPRequest` with specific SDK methods:
- `tools/list` → `mcpClient.listTools()`
- `resources/list` → `mcpClient.listResources()`
- `resources/read` → `mcpClient.readResource(params)`
- `tools/call` → `mcpClient.callTool(params)`
- `prompts/list` → `mcpClient.listPrompts()`
- `prompts/get` → `mcpClient.getPrompt(params)`

### 5. Simplified Notification Handling
- SDK handles the initialization handshake automatically
- Notifications are forwarded through `setNotificationHandler()`
- No need to manually send `notifications/initialized`

## Benefits
1. **Type Safety**: The SDK provides proper TypeScript types (though not used here)
2. **Protocol Compliance**: Automatic handling of protocol requirements
3. **Error Handling**: Built-in error handling and timeouts
4. **Maintainability**: Less code to maintain, fewer bugs
5. **Future Compatibility**: Updates to the protocol are handled by SDK updates

## Notes
- The custom transport is necessary because we manage the server process lifecycle separately
- stderr handling remains separate for debugging purposes
- The renderer process interface remains unchanged
